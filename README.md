# ‚úäüèæ Black Lives Matter

### üëã  Hello, I'm Damien, and I am a research software engineer.

I enjoy programming languages, the theory underlying them, and am quite comfortable in a few domains:
- Distributed systems
- AI/ML modeling & infrastructure
- Cloud native infrastructure / container orchestration
- Mobile
- Embedded

I think modern approaches and practices can be applied to any programming language or ecosystem. Use the tool that works, as it goes.

With that said I am particularly fond of Rust, Haskell, Clojure, and Swift. 

Here are some neat things I have been lucky enough to work on:
- Contributed to [a big open-source Rust project][4], successfully migrating the entire Firecracker codebase to Rust 2018
- Contributed to the design and scaling of a small but effective graph query language in Go.
- Contributed to the design of a fulltext search system over a distributed DB (also in Go).
- Built & maintain a relatively complex Android and iOS/macOS/visionOS SDK, and helped launch successful products around it.
- Built a successful novel information retrieval (IR) machine learning algorithm (Go, again)
- Built React and Angular frontends... not my area of expertise, but I am learning!
- Maintained and extended cross platform mobile apps (Angular/Ionic)
- Built modular Python and Scala machine learning products & supporting infrastructure
