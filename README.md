# ✊🏾 Black Lives Matter

#### 👋 Hello, I'm Damien. I'm a software engineer.

I enjoy programming languages and am fairly comfortable in several domains (mobile, distsys, AI/ML modeling, infrastructure).

For added context, here are some neat things I have worked on:
- A small but effective graph query language
- A couple distributed fulltext search systems
- A successful information retrieval (IR) machine learning algorithm
- Some big-data distributed machine learning workloads on Apache Spark
- Several distributed streaming graph compute microservices at reasonably large scale (millions of writes per second)
- A fast and easy to use data collection and aggregation CLI, and lots of infratructure tooling
- Relatively complex Android and iOS SDKs and supporting test mobile apps
- A simple but effective React app to visualize complex IoT data
