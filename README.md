# ‚úäüèæ Black Lives Matter

#### üëã Hello, I'm Damien, and I am a software engineer.

I enjoy programming languages and am quite comfortable in a few domains:
- Distributed systems
- AI/ML modeling & infrastructure
- Cloud native infrastructure / container orchestration
- Mobile

I think modern approaches and practices can be applied to any programming language or ecosystem. Use the tool that works, as it goes.

With that said I am particularly fond of Rust, Go, and Kotlin/Swift. 

Here are some neat things I have been lucky enough to work on:
- Contributed to [a big open-source Rust project][5], successfully migrating the entire Firecracker codebase to Rust 2018
- Contributed to the design and scaling of a small but effective graph query language
- Contributed to the design of a fulltext search system over a distributed DB
- Built a relatively complex Android and iOS SDK, and helped launch successful products around it
- Built a successful novel information retrieval (IR) machine learning algorithm
- Built a mapping layer in React to visualize IoT data
- Built a modular Python3 analytics codebase, and several infrastructure tools around delivering those ML services in the cloud
