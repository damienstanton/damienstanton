# ✊🏾 Black Lives Matter

#### 👋 Hello, I'm Damien. I'm a full-stack software & machine learning engineer.

Mobile apps, system programming tools, web services, and their full stack of supporting infrastructure that are _enriched by_ or _enable_ ML/AI tech are my wheelhouse. Whole systems (especially the distributed kind) are what I am into & I love to own everything from the app code to the SDKs to the ML models to the APIs/persistence. I'm opinionated but not particularly zealous about tools; for now I feel most comfortable writing Go, Rust, Swift, and Python.

#### 🤝 Want to work together?
