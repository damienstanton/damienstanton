# ‚úäüèæ Black Lives Matter

#### üëã Hello, I'm Damien. I'm a software engineer.

I enjoy programming languages and am fairly comfortable in several domains (in no particular order):
- Distributed systems
- AI/ML modeling & infrastructure
- Cloud native infrastructure / container orchestration
- Mobile

Areas I'm less comfortable:
- I'm fairly skilled at front-end and have worked on Angular and React codebases, but building UI & UX always goes a bit slow. It's not my expertise.
- I'd like to learn more about the embedded/realtime space espcially w.r.t. robotics, but I haven't really had the time yet.

For added context, here are some neat things I have worked on:
- Contributed to [a big open-source Rust project][5], migrating the entire Firecracker codebase to Rust 2018
- Contributed to a small but effective graph query language
- Contributed to the design of a distributed fulltext search system
- Built a relatively complex Android and iOS SDK, as well as a few distinct PoC apps built on the SDK
- Built a fast and easy to use data collection and aggregation CLI, and several small infrastructure tools
- Built a successful novel information retrieval (IR) machine learning algorithm
- Built a set of custom components in a larger React app to visualize complex IoT data
- Built machine-learning services & analytics reports built on Apache Spark
- Built distributed streaming graph compute microservices
