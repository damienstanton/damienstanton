# ✊🏾 Black Lives Matter

#### 👋 Hello, I'm Damien. I'm a full-stack software & machine learning engineer.

Mobile and web apps (and their full stack of supporting infrastructure) that are _enriched_ by ML/AI tech are my wheelhouse. _Systems_ are what I am into, and tools like Swift and Rust make it easier than it has ever been to make _correct, reliable, performant_ systems.  This includes native as well as hybrid e.g. React Native. I love to own everything from the app code to the SDKs to the ML models to the APIs/persistence. I'm opinionated but not particularly zealous about tools.
