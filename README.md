### üëã  Hello, I'm Damien, and I am a research software engineer.

I enjoy programming languages, the theory underlying them, and am quite comfortable in exploring the overlaps of a few cool domains:

- Embedded systems (low resource or embedded in host languages)
- Large language models and the transformer architecture
- Real-time systems and the formal modeling of autonomous systems

I think modern approaches and practices can be applied to any programming language or ecosystem. Use the tool that works, as it goes.

That being said, I most enjoy working and thinking in the ML family of languages like F# and Lean, and more removed cousins like Rust and Swift.

### ü§ù  Want to collaborate?

I am always open to discussing open source and tech with new people! Send me a message on [LinkedIn][1], or an [email][3].
