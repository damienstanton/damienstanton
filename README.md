# ‚úäüèæ Black Lives Matter

## üëã Hello, I'm Damien. I'm a full-stack machine-learning & mobile engineer.

**Just want to see the code?** Okay. Click [here][4].

In lieu of a biography or resum√© (if you want that, click [here][1]), this is an informal five-point snapshot of my preferences / skills w.r.t. software:

| | |
| -| -|
| <font size="+2">üß±</font> |I've been working on full-stack projects off and on since ~2015, with most of my experience in Angular and then later React. Browser/hybrid stuff is fun, but I tend to enjoy back-end work more. I am trying to improve my front-end and graphical design skills.|
| <font size="+2">üêπ</font> |I've been working with Go since ~2014, mostly on private projects but I contributed a bit to the TensorFlow Go bindings back in 2016 (the changes were ultimately rejected as they conflicted with the standard C headers, but it was a great learning experience!). I still write and test distributed Go API services at work, but I tend to use Go less nowadays in favor of Rust.|
| <font size="+2">ü¶Ä</font>|Starting ~2018 I've written more and more Rust, mostly small tools for private projects and workshop-ish projects in public. I am currently contributing to AWS Firecracker MicroVM written in Rust, and building a side private project in it as well. It's nice, and overcomes some of the pitfalls I've come across as a professional Go developer.|
| <font size="+2">üß†</font> |From ~2018 through 2020 I shifted to a machine learning engineer role, and worked on really fun and interesting learning models. My specialty is IR and NLP, although I did some brief side work on autonomous driving and computer vision. The machine learning programming paradigm is really amazing, and it's such a new field that working with it is really exciting. I will absolutely steer future work to projects that involve machine learning and deep learning.|
| <font size="+2">üì±</font>|In early 2020 I shifted to doing almost exclusively mobile work (plus backend/datasci on the side), for both iOS and Android platforms. It's the most fun I've had in a while, and will definitely steer my future work to full-stack projects with mobile as the core client.|

## ü§î Thinking the above is too much to read? TL;DR

So I guess this is my tech thing: 
- _Systems_ are what I am into, and tools like Swift and Rust make it easier than it has ever been to make _correct, reliable, performant_ systems. Mobile and web apps (and their full stack of supporting infrastructure) that are _enriched_ by ML/AI tech are absolutely my wheelhouse. This includes native as well as hybrid (e.g. React/React Native) systems. I love to own everything from the app code to the SDKs to the ML models to the APIs/persistence.


## ü§ù Want to work together?

I'm not currently looking for paid work. However, I am always open to collaborate!

I've been blessed to be doing well in this industry for a long time now. I love to give back where I can and I am happy to give you advice if you want it, especially if you are just starting out.
