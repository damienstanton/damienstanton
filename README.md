# ‚úäüèæ Black Lives Matter

#### üëã Hello, I'm Damien, and I am a software engineer.

Ecosystems and communities I consider myself a part of:
- Rust
- Go
- Kotlin & Swift (generally anything around mobile, including hybrid apps)
- Python

I enjoy programming languages and am quite comfortable in a few domains:
- Distributed systems
- AI/ML modeling & infrastructure
- Cloud native infrastructure / container orchestration
- Mobile

Areas I am less comfortable:
- I'm _fairly_ skilled at front-end and have worked on Angular and React codebases, but building UI & UX always goes a bit slow. It's not my expertise.
- I'd like to learn more about the embedded/realtime space espcially w.r.t. robotics, but I haven't really had the time to dive in.

For added context, here are some neat things I hve been lucky enough to do recently:
- Contributed to [a big open-source Rust project][5], successfully migrating the entire Firecracker codebase to Rust 2018
- Contributed to the design and scaling of a small but effective graph query language
- Contributed to the design of a fulltext search system over a distributed DB
- Built a relatively complex Android and iOS SDK, and helped launch successful products around it
- Built a successful novel information retrieval (IR) machine learning algorithm
- Built a mapping layer in React to visualize IoT data
- Built machine-learning services & analytics reports built on Apache Spark
- Built a modular analytics codebase, and several infrastructure tools around delivering those ML services in the cloud
